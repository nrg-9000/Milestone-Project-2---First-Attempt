# Ace dynamic value yet to be implemented
# Will need a way to progress to next round - another outer loop?

## I need to track the number of aces in the hand
## I need to start with ace value 11
## If the total value exceeds 21, then I keep subtracting 10 the number of times there are aces in the hand until it is not a bust anymore

### Inhand aces is not increasing

### Very close but there is something wrong with the logic
